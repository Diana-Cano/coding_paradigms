'''How does this solution ensure data immutability?
Is this solution a pure function? Why or why not?
yes , this would be considered a pure function because the return cakue would always be the same 
if the same arguments were put in. Also, the function has no side effects making it a oure function.


Is this solution a higher order function? Why or why not?
Would it have been easier to solve this problem using a different programming style?

Why in particular is functional programming a helpful paradigm when solving this problem?'''

'''How does this solution demonstrate the four pillars of OOP? (It may not demonstrate all of them, describe only those that apply)
Encapsulation
Abstraction
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Would it have been easier to implement a solution to this problem using a different coding style? Why or why not?
How in particular did Object Oriented Programming assist in the solving of this problem?'''
    
'''Is one of these coding paradigms "better" than the other? Why or why not?
Given the opportunity to work predominantly using either of these coding paradigms, which seems more appealing? Why?
Now being more familiar with these coding paradigms, what tasks/features/pieces of logic would be best handled using functional programming? Object Oriented Programming?
Personally, which of these styles takes more work to understand? What should be done in order to deepen understanding related to this paradigm?'''
